# Early-Stage-Diabetes-Risk-Prediction

## Objective:

My main goal is to use the power of data science algorithms, tools and techniques to predict diabetes in the early stage of life so preventive measures can be taken in advance. Diabetes is the most common disease that people can get in their early stages of life or mid-life. It also comes as heredity from parents to their child if either or both of the parent has a diabetic history. In order to provide our analysis and prediction we will use "Pima Indians Diabetes Database" from Kaggle.

**Data set Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

In order to predict diabetes I have applied Decision Tree,Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier to see which models gives better prediction. Hyperparameter optimization is applied to best peroforming model and also applied 10 k-fold cross-validtion to find best accuracy of model.

**Things Which I have performed in Python Notebook File are as below:**

1. Basic Exploration of Data
2. Handling Missing/Garbage Values
3. Data Visualization
4. Applying and Evaluating Classificaion Models For Prediction
5. Applying Hyperparameter Optimization And 10 k-fold Cross Validation To Best Performing Model
6. Feature Importance.

## Data Description:

<p>This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, <b>all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.</b></p>

<p>The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.</p>
